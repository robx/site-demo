title: Drawing puzzles with TikZ
---

There seems to be a lack of information out there when it comes to rendering 
puzzles. The most obvious approach is probably to use a vector graphics 
program such as [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), but people also use 
spreadsheet software or write Postscript directly. I've recently started 
using the Haskell [Diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) framework 
(more on that in a future post), but for today, I want to share how to render 
pretty puzzles using TikZ via LaTeX.

Simplifying things a bit, [TikZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) is a 
vector graphics package for the [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) 
document preparation system. If you want to follow along at home, install 
some TeX system, typically via your OS' packaging system or from [TeX 
Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). We'll be writing a text file 
`puzzle.tex`; running `pdflatex puzzle.tex` will yield `puzzle.pdf` if 
nothing goes wrong. Or use [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/).

As an example, we'll draw a small Slalomrundweg, see the 
[RÃ¤tselportal](http://www.logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=00016Q) 
for the rules. Here's what it will look like:

![Slalomrundweg](/images/slalomrundweg.png){ width=380px }

We'll start with some boilerplate; it's a good idea to keep the code below in 
a file `template.tex`:

    \documentclass{article}
    
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{arrows}
    
    \usepackage[tightpage,active]{preview}
    \PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}
    
    \begin{document}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
    
    % insert puzzle here
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{document}

This sets up a basic LaTex document that consists of a single TikZ picture. 
We tell LaTeX to load TikZ, including the `arrows` library, and to produce an 
output file that contains just the `tikzpicture` we're going to fill in 
below. Cropping the document to that picture is what the mysterious `preview` 
stuff is for. One thing to note is the option `scale` to the `tikzpicture` 
environment: The default unit is 1cm, so this makes our grid cells have size 
8mm.

Let's put in a grid:

    \draw[thin, black!50] (0,0) grid (6,6);
    \draw[very thick] (0,0) rectangle (6,6);

Pretty easy, right? Paste this inside the `tikzpicture` environment and render it, and you should see an empty grid. The edges might not be very nice because of how `preview` crops the document to the picture; we could fix this by setting a `PreviewBorder`, but instead we'll just enlarge the picture size. This will also make the image stay centered once we add the arrows.
    
    \path (-1,-1) rectangle (7,7);

`\path` is like `\draw`, except that it doesn't use a pen. Next, we'll add 
the clues. To just put the letter `A` at the point (2,3), we'd use
`\node at (2,3) {A};`, but we need a little more than that for our circled clues.

    \tikzstyle{clue} = [
        circle,
        draw,
        fill=white,
        inner sep=2pt,
        font=\sffamily\large
    ]
    
    \foreach \x/\y/\c in {1/1/1, 1/5/1, 5/1/3, 5/5/4, 3/3/1}
        \node[clue] at (\x,\y) {\c};

First we define the style of our clue nodes. This isn't strictly necessary, 
it just means that when we write `\node[clue]`, the `clue` part is replaced 
by all the things in the earlier list. Those are:

`circle`

:    the outline of the node is a circle

`draw`

:    we want the outline to be drawn

`fill=white`

:    we fill the background in white, to cover the grid lines

`inner sep=2pt`

:    a margin between the text and the circle (the node is sized to accomodate the text, which might not really be what we want here...)

`font=\sffamily\large`

:    choose the text font and size

Then, we use `\foreach` to place the clues at the given coordinates.

Finally, let's add the arrows for the solution code. There's some tricky 
stuff here that's required to get them to look just right.
    
    \tikzstyle{arr} = [
        -triangle 90,
        line width=0.4mm,
        postaction={draw, line width=0.1cm, shorten >=0.1cm, -}
    ]
    \draw[arr] (-0.7,3) -- (-0.2,3);
    \draw[arr] (3,6.7) -- (3,6.2);

That's it! As a bonus, and at the risk of spoiling the puzzle, add the 
following. Best between drawing the grid and drawing the clues.
    
    \draw[ultra thick, black!70]
        (3,5) -- (1,3) -- (3,1) -- (5,3)
        (1,1) -- (2,2)    (1,5) -- (2,4)
        (4,0) -- (6,2)    (5,1) -- (6,0)
        (3,3) -- (6,6)    (4,6) -- (6,4);
    \draw[ultra thick, red!70]
        (1,0) -- (2,1) -- (3,0) -- (6,3)
              -- (5,4) -- (3,2) -- (2,3)
              -- (4,5) -- (3,6) -- (2,5)
              -- (1,6) -- (0,5) -- (1,4)
              -- (0,3) -- (1,2) -- (0,1) -- (1,0);
